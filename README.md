# Domino_App_Project

The goal of this project is to design an android app that uses computer vision to tabulate the score for a game of dominos. 

# Motivation

Totaling scores after a game of dominos can be annoying and the game would be more enjoyable if there was an app to do that. Skimage offers tools and utilities that engage methods for object recognition and detection. This project motivates the use of these packages in order to facilitate a GUI application.

# Phase I: Domino dot recognition (SciKit Image and PIL)

The goal of this phase is to write a program that can detect and count dots and blank spaces for various domino arrangement. During the coding process, it is salient to account for noisy backgrounds, blurry images, cropped out dominos, colored dominos and dots, shadows, and other anomalies that may be captured by a phone camera.

**Methods (Codes Available in Repo):
1. Defining and drawing contours
2. ImageProps
3. Edge Detection
4. Filtering (High Pass filtering followed by one of the above methods)
5. Convolutions
6. Blob Detection

# Phase II: App Design (Kivi and Android Studio)
We are currently in the process of developing an app to integrate our domino detection code using Kivi and Android Studio. The goal is to create a UI that is appealing and user-friendly on Android devices using Python code. More to come soon.
