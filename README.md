# The Graveyard

This branch was created for testing various detection codes, but now serves as a graveyard for all failed detection attempts. None of these work well in practical use, and some don't work well in a controlled use case either. 

See the [Image-Processing-Codes](https://github.com/ZaneDaPayne/Domino_App_Project/tree/Image-Processing-Codes) branch for better detection funcitons.
