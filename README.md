# Overview of Branch
This branch is contains all the SciKit Processing Codes that were tested/used to build the detection mechanism. 
Download the .ipynb files to see how each detection method works for an image. The test.ipynb file contains a template for CNN dot detection. The images in this branch were used as trial images for the detection methods or as templates. 
All codes can be optimized to improve the accuracy of the detection.
